# Competitive programming prewritten source codes
A collection of prewritten competitive programming algorithms.

These are data structures and algorithms that are usually tedious and error-prone if implemented under pressure.

Although this is far from a proof of correctness, all the source codes in this repository have been used to get AC verdict on at least one competitive programming problem on some online judge (usually codeforces.com).

All source codes are "templatized" and generalized as much as possible.

I admit suggestions and improvements.
