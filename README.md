# Competitive programming prewritten source codes
A collection of prewritten competitive programming algorithms.

These are data structures and algorithms that are usually tedious and error-prone if implemented under pressure.

Although it is far from a proof of correctness, all the source codes in this repository have been used to get AC verdict on at least one competitive programming problem on some online judge (usually codeforces.com).

I admit suggestions and improvements.
